# ✨ **What is Trip Splitter?**

**Trip Splitter** is a simple and beautifully designed web app to manage shared expenses during group trips.

Whether you're traveling to **Vizag, Goa, Himachal, Thailand, or Europe** — this app helps you and your friends:

✔ Track who paid what
✔ Split expenses fairly
✔ Manage categories
✔ View analytics
✔ Instantly see **who owes whom**
✔ Export the entire trip spending

All from your phone or browser.
No login. No installations.
Just a clean shared link.

# 🧠 **Why We Built This**

Most expense-splitter apps are either:

❌ Too complicated
❌ Require account creation
❌ Filled with ads
❌ Not customizable
❌ Hard to deploy privately

**Trip Splitter solves all of this.**

We wanted:

* A **simple, one-page** interface
* A clean databased-backed approach
* No passwords stored in code
* An app that anyone can deploy for their friends
* Real-time updates
* Professional-grade UI and analytics

This repo helps you deploy your **own** hosted Trip Splitter using:

⚡ Streamlit Cloud
🍃 MongoDB Atlas
🐍 Python
📊 Altair (charts)

# 🏗️ **How It’s Built**

Trip Splitter is built with a clean and modular architecture so beginners can understand it — and developers can extend it.

```
src/
 └── trip_splitter/
       ├── app.py            # Main Streamlit app UI
       ├── db.py             # MongoDB connection logic
       ├── logic.py          # Splitting + settlement logic
       ├── ui_components/    # Reusable UI elements
       └── utils/            # Helpers, validation, formatting
```

### 🚀 Frontend

* Built using **Streamlit**
* Responsive sidebar-based navigation
* Auto-refresh UI
* Clean expanders & charts
* Works on **mobile & desktop**

### 🧩 Backend

* Python + MongoDB Atlas
* Collections auto-created
* All write operations validated
* Optimized settlement logic (greedy settlement algorithm)

### 📊 Visualizations

* Powered by **Altair**
* Category breakdowns
* Day-wise trend charts
* Per-person balances
* Exportable CSVs

### 🔐 Security

* No secrets in code
* Database credentials stored safely in **Streamlit Secrets Manager**
* Each user deploys their **own private DB**
* App only reads your secrets — never exposes them

---

# 🔧 **Main Components**

### 🧳 1. Trip Management

* Create multiple trips
* Add/edit participants
* Add custom categories

### 💸 2. Expense Recording

* Select payer
* Add amount & description
* Choose category
* Exclude people from split (optional)
* Timestamp auto-recorded

### 📊 3. Visual Analytics

* Per-person summary
* Pie chart per category
* Daily log view
* Total expense overview

### 🤝 4. Settlement Engine

Automatically computes:

```
ALICE should receive ₹1,200
BOB should pay ₹650
CHARAN should pay ₹550
```

And displays **optimized pairwise settlements**, like:

```
👉 BOB → ALICE: ₹650
👉 CHARAN → ALICE: ₹550
```

### ⬇️ 5. Export System

* Export full raw expenses as CSV
* Export summary as CSV

### 🔗 6. Share With Friends

Once deployed:

* You get a public URL
* Anyone can open on phone
* Everyone sees the same trip data
* Works in real time
